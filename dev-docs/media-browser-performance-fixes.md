# Media Browser Performance Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Browser showing only one video when adding multiple videos
**Problem**: When importing multiple videos, the `UPDATE_MEDIA_FILES` action was replacing the entire array instead of merging updates, causing only the last file to be visible.

**Solution**: Modified the `UPDATE_MEDIA_FILES` action in `app-settings-machine.ts` to use a Map-based merge strategy:
```typescript
UPDATE_MEDIA_FILES: {
  actions: [
    assign({
      mediaFiles: ({ context, event }) => {
        // Create Map for fast lookup by id
        const existingFilesMap = new Map(
          context.mediaFiles.allFiles.map((file: any) => [file.id, file])
        );
        
        // Update existing files or add new ones
        event.files.forEach((file: any) => {
          existingFilesMap.set(file.id, file);
        });
        
        // Convert back to array
        const updatedFiles = Array.from(existingFilesMap.values());
        
        return {
          ...context.mediaFiles,
          allFiles: updatedFiles,
          isLoading: false,
          error: null,
        };
      },
    }),
  ],
},
```

### 2. Severe performance issues when loading folders with many videos
**Problems identified**:
- `VideoPreview` component was loading entire video files into memory using `readFile`
- All video elements had `preload="auto"` causing immediate loading of all videos
- No virtualization - all media items rendered regardless of viewport visibility

**Solutions implemented**:

#### a) Removed memory-intensive file loading
Changed from loading entire video files into memory to using streaming:
```typescript
// Before: Loading entire file into memory
const fileData = await readFile(path)
const blob = new Blob([fileData], { type: "video/mp4" })
const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob)

// After: Direct streaming via convertFileSrc
const assetUrl = convertFileSrc(path)
return assetUrl
```

#### b) Changed video preload strategy
Changed all video elements from `preload="auto"` to `preload="metadata"` to prevent automatic loading of video content.

#### c) Implemented virtualization for media lists
Created `VirtualizedContentGroup` component that:
- Only renders visible items plus a small buffer
- Calculates visible range based on scroll position
- Maintains smooth scrolling with proper height calculations
- Supports all view modes (list, grid, thumbnails)

### 3. Missing video previews when loading many videos
The virtualization implementation ensures that only visible previews are rendered, preventing resource exhaustion that was causing previews to fail loading.

## Performance Improvements

1. **Memory usage**: Significantly reduced by not loading video files into memory
2. **Initial load time**: Faster due to metadata-only preloading
3. **Scrolling performance**: Smooth scrolling even with thousands of files due to virtualization
4. **Preview reliability**: All previews now load correctly as only visible ones are rendered

## Additional Optimizations

- Media import already uses batched metadata loading with a concurrent request pool (MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 3)
- Updates are batched using `requestAnimationFrame` for optimal rendering performance
- Memoization is used throughout components to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with large folders (1000+ videos)
2. Monitor memory usage during scrolling
3. Verify all previews load correctly
4. Check performance across different view modes (list, grid, thumbnails)
5. Test with various video formats and sizes

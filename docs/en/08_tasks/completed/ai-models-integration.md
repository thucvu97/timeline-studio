## Usage Examples

```
User: "Add Russian subtitles to the video"
AI: "Analyzing audio track... Done! Detected 3 minutes of speech. 
     Generated Russian subtitles. Would you like to preview?"

User: "Remove all pauses longer than 2 seconds"
AI: "Found 5 pauses longer than 2 seconds. 
     Total pause duration: 15 seconds. Remove them?"

User: "Make the video more dynamic"
AI: "I suggest the following improvements:
     1. Speed up scene transitions
     2. Add energetic music
     3. Apply color correction for more contrast
     Apply all changes?"

User: "Prepare video for TikTok"
AI: "For TikTok I recommend:
     - Crop to vertical 9:16 format
     - Shorten duration to 60 seconds
     - Add attention-grabbing title
     - Enhance color saturation
     Start adaptation?"
```

## Success Metrics

- 50% reduction in routine operation time
- Improved final video quality
- Increased user engagement
- Lower entry barrier for beginners
